# Final Project Repository storing Feature Analysis, Model Training Jupyter Notebooks and Four Iterations of Fake News Detection Web App

## Structure

- Data_Cleaning_and_Processing_Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks related to dataset preprocessing and cleaning
- Explainability_Experiments_SHAP_and_LIME_Testing: Jupyter Notebooks related to developing and testing explainable AI techniques for later integration with the web app
- Exploratory_Feature_Analysis_Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks containing multi-stage semantic and linguistic feature analysis to inform feature selection
- Iterative_Model_Development_Notebooks: stores different iterations of fake news detection feature engineering and model pipeleines
- LLM_Experiments_with_Prompt_Learning: details experiments showing attempts to implement the TELLER prompt-driven fake news detection architecture (ultimately abandoned due to slow processing time)
- News_App_Iteration_<version>: four iterations of the LIME-driven explainable fake news detection web app
- Results_Tables: detailed results for five different classifier models
